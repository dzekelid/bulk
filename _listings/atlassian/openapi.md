      summary: Bulk set issue property
      description: |-
        Allows to set a property for all issues identified by a given filter. Only entities the user has permissions to edit will be updated.

        Currently the following filters are available:

        *   **entityIds** \- A list of issues to update. Only issues with ids from this list will be considered for updating. This is an optional filter, if not provided, then any editable issue that matches all other filters will be updated.
        *   **currentValue** \- If provided, then only issues with the property currently set to that value will be updated.
        *   **hasProperty** \- If true, then only existing properties will be updated. If false, then only issues that do not have any value associated with this property will be updated. If omitted, the property will be set on all issues, regardless of whether it previously existed or not.

        If more than one filter is given, then they are all joined with the logical "and", that is: only issues that satisfy all filters are updated. If no filters are provided at all, then the property will be updated on _all_ issues editable by the caller (i.e. issues in projects with the EDIT_ISSUES permission).

        If an invalid combination of filters is provided, an error will be returned by the API. For example, specifying the current value and "hasProperty" to "false" would never match any issues (as it would mean: update this property if the current value is something, oh, but only if there is no value at all) and is therefore not allowed.

        This method is [asynchronous](#async), meaning that it will not return the results immediately, instead creating a task to perform the requested update operation (unless preliminary validation, e.g. of the provided filter, fails).

        The operation is transactional: either all eligible issues are updated, or none (if there are any errors).
